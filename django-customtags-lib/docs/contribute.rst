================================
Contribute to django-classy-tags
================================

As with (hopefully) any open source project, contribution is very welcome.

************************
Review the documentation
************************

A great way to contribute to django-classy-tags, which requires absolutely no
coding skills and can be done by anyone who knows English, is to read this
documentation and inform me about any mistakes in the documentation. Also any
suggestion on how to write the documentation clearer and easier to understand
would be greatly appreciated.

If you use django-classy-tags yourself as a developer and found certain things
in the documentation to be unclear to you or you would like to have more in 
depth documentation on some features, please also tell me so I can make it
easier for people to use this project.


***************
Spread the word
***************

Tell people about this project! The more people use it the higher the chance the
quality of this project will increase.


**********************
Improve the test suite
**********************

There is a handy little test framework located in the testdata folder. It allows
automated testing of django-classy-tags implementation against builtin Django
tags. Have a look at the existing tags and feel free to add more!

Also adding good old unit tests is a great way to help too.


**********
Write code
**********

Want a feature implemented or a bug eliminated? The quickest way to get there is
to write the code yourself and get it back to me.

Please note that your code must have *full* test coverage and *full*
documentation coverage, otherwise it won't be pulled into the main repository.
